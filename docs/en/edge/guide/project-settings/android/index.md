Project Settings for Android
===================================

The **config.xml settings file** controls various settings of Cordova. This is application wide, and not set per CordovaWebView Instance.  For example:

        <cordova>
            <preference name="MySetting" value="true" />
            <plugins>
                <plugin name="MyPlugin" value="MyPluginClass" />
            </plugins>
            <access origin="*" />
        </cordova>

1. A list of **plugins** allowed to be used in a CordovaWebView.
2. A **white-list** of hosts that Cordova is allowed to connect to (add an **&lt;access&gt;** tag, and set the origin attribute - wildcards allowed)
3. Various **other** preferences (as **&lt;preference&gt;** tags) defaults err on not breaking existing apps)

a. **useBrowserHistory (boolean, defaults to true)** - set to false if you want to use the history shim that was used to work around the hashtag error present in Android 3.x prior to the history fix.  (Note: This setting will be deprecated in April 2013)
