<p class="sub-paragraph">The guides in this section cover all of the PhoneGap specific tooling documentation guides for reference. If you're new to PhoneGap, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started guides](/getting-started) first to get started most quickly with the least amount of setup. Once you've gone through it you'll have a better understanding of the tools and options available.</p>
