 When you're ready to take your mobile application development further or decide you want to build for each platform locally yourself, you can find the specific instructions for each platform
 in the [getting started guides](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_platforms_index.md.html#Platform%20Guides). </div>
