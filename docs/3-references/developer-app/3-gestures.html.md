### Refresh your App
The PhoneGap Developer app will automatically reload any changes made to your apps, however, you can also use a 4-finger tap 
gesture to force a reload of your app at any time. 

### Return Home
A 3-finger tap gesture will return you back to the home screen if you need to connect to a new IP address.
