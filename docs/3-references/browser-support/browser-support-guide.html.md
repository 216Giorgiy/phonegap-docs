### Overview

One of the biggest benefits of hybrid app development is the ability to develop a large pat of your app without ever 
leaving your desktop. You can leverage your desktop browser and the built-in tooling to test your apps until you specifically
 need to access specific device features. You can even ensure your components are laid out properly using the Chrome Deeloper tools
 built-in [mobile device emulator](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/device-mode/).

### Plugins
All of the core Cordova plugins also include desktop browser support so you can still continue your testing in the browser. Some
will return mock data and some will simply err silently so you can continue along with your other testing.
