### Multiple Platform Support  
The addition of the browser platform does not affect the multi-device functionality that was already present when serving apps. With it you 
 can now serve your apps and test them in the browser as well as on an Android, iOS or Windows device all at the same time with
live reloading. This allows you to quickly test changes across multiple devices while still taking advantage of the browser's developer tooling
to help you iterate through your development stages rapidly.
