### Overview

The PhoneGap CLI provides a command line interface for creating PhoneGap apps as an alternative to using the
[PhoneGap Desktop App](/references/desktop-app). The PhoneGap CLI was the main tool used for creating PhoneGap 
apps prior to PhoneGap Desktop and contains additional features over the PhoneGap Desktop for building, running 
and packaging PhoneGap applications for multiple platforms. 
    
### Supported Platforms
The PhoneGap CLI is supported on Mac and Windows.

<div class="alert--info">The PhoneGap CLI is built as a layer on top of the Apache Cordova CLI, and any command that can be used in Cordova
will also be supported by the PhoneGap CLI. This guide will specifically detail the *additional* features and commands that separate the PhoneGap 
 CLI from the Cordova CLI and should be used along with the [Cordova CLI Reference](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/index.html).
