The PhoneGap Desktop App is the easiest way to get started with PhoneGap. It’s an alternative to the PhoneGap CLI but uses the 
same libraries behind the scenes with no complicated installation. You don’t need git, npm, or even node.js, you simply install
 the app to your desktop and get started creating apps.
