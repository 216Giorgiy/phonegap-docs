### Overview
The PhoneGap Desktop App is the easiest way to get started with PhoneGap. It's an alternative to the PhoneGap CLI yet uses the 
same libraries behind the scenes with no complicated installation. You don't need `git`, `npm`, or even `Node.js`, you simply install
 it to your desktop, create a project and run it on your device.
