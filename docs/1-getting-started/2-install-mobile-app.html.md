The [PhoneGap Developer App](http://app.phonegap.com) is a wrapper application that runs on your devices and allows you to preview and test the PhoneGap mobile
applications you build on multiple devices across platforms without the need to install and set up each platform SDK. It automatically
includes all of the PhoneGap core API plugins allowing instant access to the native device features without having to add them yourself, 
providing a sandbox for you to get started developing PhoneGap mobile apps quickly. 

Begin by installing PhoneGap Developer to one of your mobile devices running on iOS, Android or Windows Phone. 

1. Locate the free PhoneGap Developer mobile app from one of the following app marketplaces and install it to your mobile device:

	- [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id843536693)
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.phonegap.app)
	- [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/phonegap-developer/5c6a2d1e-4fad-4bf8-aaf7-71380cc84fe3)

2. Once installed, click on the app icon ![](/images/dev-app-icon.png) to open it. You should see a screen like the following:

3. Once you've verified your installation, move on to the next section where you will install a desktop tool to create and serve your
first mobile application for the PhoneGap Developer app to preview.

<div class="alert--info">**NOTE:** The platform SDK's mentioned above refer to the software development kits Apple, Google and Microsoft provide to build applications for their platforms (iOS, Android and Windows respectively).
 When you're ready to take your mobile application development further or decide you want to build for each platform locally yourself, you can find the specific instructions for each platform
 in the [getting started guides](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_platforms_index.md.html#Platform%20Guides). </div>
