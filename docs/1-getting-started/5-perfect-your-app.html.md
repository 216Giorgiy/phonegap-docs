### Build, Package and Distribute for Production

This getting started workflow is meant for beginning mobile application development with PhoneGap in the quickest and simplest manner. 
At some point you will want to move out of the sandbox environment and into a more advanced environment suitable for 
building, packaging and distributing your mobile application. 
 
There are two choices available for building and packaging your applications:

1. [Build and package locally using the PhoneGap CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface)
2. [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) - a cloud service for simplifying the build and packaging process

Which you choose will depend on how comfortable you are working with a command line environment and more closely with the native SDK's and tools versus 
leaving it to a cloud service and providing the required details.  

### Configure, Develop, Debug, Distribute
Once you've become familiar with the getting started process for building mobile applications with PhoneGap and are ready for more, be sure 
to check out the rest of the PhoneGap Documentation for tutorials and tips on how further configure, develop, debug and distribute your PhoneGap apps.
