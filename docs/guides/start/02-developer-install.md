The PhoneGap Developer App allows you to preview and test the PhoneGap mobile apps you build on multiple devices across different platforms without the need to install and set up each platform SDK.*  You simply install the app to the devices you want to preview your apps on by following these steps below:

1. Locate the free PhoneGap Developer mobile app from one of the following app marketplaces and install it to your mobile device:

	- [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id843536693)
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.phonegap.app)
	- [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/phonegap-developer/5c6a2d1e-4fad-4bf8-aaf7-71380cc84fe3)

2. Once installed, click on the app icon ![](/images/dev-app-icon.png) to open it. You should see a screen like the following:

3. Once installed, move on to the next section where you will install a desktop tool that can be used to create and serve an app for the PhoneGap Developer app to preview.

* The platform SDK's refer to the software development kits Apple, Google and Microsoft provide for building applications for their platforms (iOS, Android and Windows respectively). The details for getting started with the different platform SDKs to build PhoneGap apps are also available [here](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_platforms_index.md.html#Platform%20Guides) if you would start with that path directly instead.
