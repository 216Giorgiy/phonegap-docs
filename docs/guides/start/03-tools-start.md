### PhoneGap App Creation Tools
Two desktop tools are available for creating PhoneGap projects, the **PhoneGap CLI** (command line interface) and the **PhoneGap Desktop App** (graphical user interface) tool.

Choose one of these tools below to get started:
   ###1. [PhoneGap CLI](/guides/cli/index.html)
   ###2. [PhoneGap Desktop App (GUI)](/guides/desktop/index.html)

<div class="alert--info">**TIP:** If you're more comfortable using command line tools then choose the **PhoneGap CLI** option, otherwise start with the **PhoneGap Desktop App**. Both tools use the same underlying libraries and will allow you to quickly create and preview your app. </div>
