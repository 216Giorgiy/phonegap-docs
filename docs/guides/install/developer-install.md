##Step 2: Install the PhoneGap Developer App<hr>

The *PhoneGap Developer App* allows you to preview and test the PhoneGap mobile app projects you build on multiple devices across different platforms without having to install and set up each platform SDK.  All you need to do is install the app to the devices you would like to preview your own apps on and go through the next couple quick steps in this guide to see exactly how it works.

1. Locate the free PhoneGap Developer mobile app from one of the following app marketplaces and install it to your mobile device:

	- [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id843536693)
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.phonegap.app)
	- [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/phonegap-developer/5c6a2d1e-4fad-4bf8-aaf7-71380cc84fe3)

2. Once installed, click on the app icon <img src="../images/dev-app-icon.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle"/> to open it. You should see a screen that looks like below:
