##PhoneGap Installation Guide

In this guide we'll cover everything you need to know to get PhoneGap up and running so you can start building awesome mobile apps. 

The fastest way to get started using PhoneGap is to install one of the PhoneGap desktop tools and pair it with the PhoneGap Developer app installed on your mobile device.  
   <div class="callout callout-info"><button class="btn-info">i</button> The desktop tools are used to **create** your mobile app projects, while the PhoneGap Developer App is used to **preview** and **test** the apps directly on your mobile device. </div>

###Part 1: Install a Desktop Tool
Two desktop tools are available to choose from depending on your personal preference and comfort level. The *PhoneGap Command Line Interface (CLI)* tool and the *PhoneGap Desktop App*. 

Select one of the following options below for specific installation instructions.  You will be taken to the next step from there. 

1. [The PhoneGap Command Line Interface (CLI)](cli-install.html)

2. [The PhoneGap Desktop App](desktop-install.html)
<div class="callout callout-help"> <button class="btn-help">Tip</button> If you're most comfortable on the command line or using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](http://npmjs.org) then choose the CLI option, otherwise you may want to start with the PhoneGap Desktop App. Both tools use the same underlying libraries and will allow you to create, build and run your project. </div>
