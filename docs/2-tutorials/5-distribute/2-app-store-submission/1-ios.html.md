### Steps

2. Review App Store Submission Guidelines
3. Enter Information in iTunes Connect
iTunes Connect is a web tool you use to enter information about your app for sale in the App Store or the Mac App Store. iTunes Connect stores all the metadata about your app including the versions and builds that you upload using Xcode. Before you upload your app, create an app record in iTunes Connect, as described in Creating an iTunes Connect Record for an App. Then enter all the required information, described in Viewing and Changing Your Appâ€™s Metadata.
