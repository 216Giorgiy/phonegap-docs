Welcome to the new version of the PhoneGap Docs! We're working on putting together
a comprehensive resource that covers all things PhoneGap and mobile app development,
that is both in-depth and easy to follow.
</p>

<p style="color:#111111;font-size:1.1rem;line-height:1.7rem;">
We didn't want to keep you waiting for all the good stuff, so we've published
some key resources to get you going. If you are new to PhoneGap, we recommend
beginning by working through our <a href="/getting-started">Getting Started Guide</a>.
We've also put together a helpful <a href="/tutorials">tutorial</a> on extending our
"Hello World" example app. These should get you going, and keep your eyes for new material
to come soon.
